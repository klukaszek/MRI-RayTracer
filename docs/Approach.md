The most effective approach, supported by the sources, is to implement a **Differentiable Hybrid Raycasting Pipeline** (similar to Neural Ray-Tracing (NRT) or FEGR) which disentangles geometric structure from appearance parameters, making the medical scans easier to interpret and potentially more accurate.

Below is a structured guide detailing the necessary research and implementation steps, heavily leveraging the principles of automatic differentiation (autodiff) and neural rendering found in the sources.

## Guide to Implementing a Differentiable Raycasting Model for MRI

### Phase 0: Foundations and Environment Setup

#### 0.1 Leverage Slang for Automatic Differentiation

Since runtime performance is not an issue and you have the **Slang** environment ready, the core training loop must be built using its automatic differentiation features.

- **Autodiff Core:** The central mechanism is generating backward derivative functions using `bwd_diff(loss)(...)` in your Slang code. This avoids manual gradient derivation for complex volumetric and ray-casting operations.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Utilize the Slang Python interface (`SlangPy`) to wrap Slang functions, load network parameters, run the forward/backward passes, and apply optimizers (like Adam) in Python, facilitating fast experimentation and debugging.

#### 0.2 Integrate Preprocessed Data

Your data pipeline provides crucial geometric supervision that sidesteps many of the challenges faced by monolithic NeRF systems (which entangle geometry and appearance).

- **Geometric Constraint:** The **Boundary map $B(x)$** (Signed Distance Transform/SDF) is critical. It serves as direct ground truth for guiding the learning of the implicit geometry model.
- **Feature Enrichment:** The co-registered multi-modal NIfTI volumes (FLAIR, T1, T2, etc.) and the **Tumor probability $P(x)$** should be passed as **input features** to the neural networks defining density and color, providing rich, location-specific context for tissue classification and appearance.

### Phase 1: Neural Scene Representation

The scene volume (the MRI scan) must be represented by a set of differentiable neural networks—known as a **Neural Intrinsic Field**.

|Component|Function|Representation / Implementation Detail|Source Reference|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Geometry** ($\mathbf{s}$)|Implicit surface model (SDF).|**MLP** parameterized by $\theta_{SDF}$, mapping 3D position $\mathbf{x} \rightarrow s$. Use **multi-resolution hash encoding** (as feature input) for high-frequency detail.||
|**Appearance** ($\mathbf{k_d}, \mathbf{k_s}$)|Material/Appearance (e.g., density, tissue color).|**MLP** parameterized by $\theta_{mat}$, mapping 3D position $\mathbf{x}$ (and potentially multi-modal features) $\rightarrow$ Base Color ($\mathbf{k_d}$) and material parameters ($\mathbf{k_s}$, e.g., opacity/transparency).||
|**Density/Radiance (Alternative)** ($\sigma, \mathbf{c}$)|Volumetric representation.|If skipping explicit SDF, use **Anisotropic Gaussian Basis Functions** to model density $\sigma(\mathbf{x})$ and emitted radiance $\mathbf{c}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{d})$. Ensure $\mathbf{c}$ is view-dependent using **Spherical Harmonics/Gaussians** for complex appearance.||

### Phase 2: Differentiable Hybrid Raycasting (The Forward Pass)

The rendering pipeline must be broken down into differentiable steps that leverage both volumetric accumulation and efficient ray tracing.

#### 2.1 Primary Ray Rendering (G-Buffer)

For each pixel, launch a ray and perform volumetric integration along the ray $r(t) = o + td$ to generate intermediate surface properties (the G-Buffer):

1. **Opaque Density ($\rho$):** The density used for rendering must be derived from the learned SDF. Use the formulation where $\rho(r(t))$ is recovered from the underlying SDF $s$ using a function like $\Phi_{\kappa}$ (a Sigmoid).
2. **Volumetric Integration:** Compute the final G-Buffer values (Normal $\mathbf{N}$, Depth $\mathbf{D}$, and intrinsic Material parameters $\mathbf{K_d}, \mathbf{K_s}$) using the standard volume rendering integral based on density $\rho$ and accumulated transmittance $T(t)$.

#### 2.2 Secondary Effects and Visibility Modeling

Accurate rendering of internal structures requires precise visibility calculation, or "shadowing," where structures block the view of others. This is where the hybrid approach excels.

1. **Mesh Extraction:** Periodically during training, extract an **explicit mesh $\mathbf{S}$** from the current, optimized SDF using an algorithm like **Marching Cubes**. This mesh serves as an acceleration structure.
2. **Visibility Query:** For a given point $\mathbf{x}$ in the volume (from the G-buffer) and a direction $\omega_i$, use the mesh $\mathbf{S}$ to efficiently determine visibility $\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}, \omega_i, \mathbf{S})$ (a boolean indicator for occlusion) via hardware-accelerated **ray-mesh intersection queries** (e.g., using DXR/OptiX which can be exposed through Slang).
3. **Final Shading:** The rendered image color $C_{render}$ is computed by combining the G-buffer intrinsic properties ($\mathbf{K_d}, \mathbf{K_s}$) with the illumination/visibility components. In medical visualization, this is simplified from traditional BRDF reflection to accurately represent accumulated density/opacity and local occlusion/shadowing from adjacent structures.

### Phase 3: Training and Optimization (The Inverse Pass)

The training loop iteratively optimizes the parameters ($\theta_{SDF}, \theta_{mat}$, etc.) to minimize the error between the rendered output and the target data.

#### 3.1 Loss Function Definition

The overall loss function ($L$) should prioritize image quality and geometric accuracy.

$$L = L_{render} + \lambda_{reg}L_{reg} + \lambda_{geom}L_{geom}$$

- **Reconstruction Loss ($L_{render}$):** Use a combination of $\mathbf{L_1}$ loss and **DSSIM** (structural dissimilarity) to minimize the perceptual difference between the rendered output $C_{render}$ and the ground truth image $I_{ref}$.
- **Geometric Regularization ($L_{geom}$):** Leverage your preprocessed data:
    - **SDF Supervision:** Use the input distance maps $B(x)$ to directly supervise the learned Signed Distance $s(x)$.
    - **Depth Supervision:** If depth data or LiDAR data is available (analogous to dense point clouds extracted from MRI), minimize the L1 loss between the rendered depth $D(r)$ and the ground truth $D_{gt}(r)$.
- **Model Regularization ($L_{reg}$):** Necessary to constrain the ill-posed nature of the problem.
    - **Eikonal Regularization:** $R_{SDF} = E_{\forall x}[||\nabla SDF(x)|| - 1]^2$. This enforces the distance function constraint, stabilizing geometry.
    - **Normal Regularization ($L_{norm}$):** Regularize the normals predicted by the volumetric integral against the highly accurate normals derived analytically from the SDF gradient.

#### 3.2 Optimization Strategy

The implementation should follow a structured, differentiable inverse rendering loop:

1. **Staged Optimization:** Start by optimizing the geometric components (SDF and initial density parameters) with only the geometric and basic rendering losses. Once geometry converges, introduce the full complexity of the material/appearance MLPs (e.g., $\mathbf{K_d}, \mathbf{K_s}$ layers).
2. **Gradient Calculation:** In the Slang environment, the entire process—from calculating $\mathbf{s}$, propagating it through the volume integral to $C_{render}$, and calculating the final loss $L$—is automatically differentiated. You call `bwd_diff(L)`.
3. **Parameter Update:** Use a robust optimizer like **Adam**. This algorithm processes the computed gradients to iteratively adjust network weights and intrinsic parameters (like those defining Gaussian scales or positions). The parameters are updated to minimize the computed loss.

### Key Implementation Focus (Slang/Performance)

Given your use of Slang, consider optimizing the MLP performance:

- **Hardware Acceleration:** Neural network inference can utilize GPU accelerators (Tensor Cores) through Slang's **Cooperative Vector** functions and intrinsics. This provides efficient FLOPS, which, while not required for "runtime" speed per your query, dramatically speeds up the _training time_ (iteration efficiency).
- **Efficiency Techniques:** Implement techniques to manage large models, such as carefully converting matrices to optimal layouts offline and minimizing data divergence in the MLP layers, crucial for leveraging GPU architecture fully.
  
Drawing upon the capabilities described in the sources, particularly in Neural Ray-Tracing (NRT) and hybrid rendering systems like FEGR and RayGauss, here are thoughts on how to leverage these constraints for research and implementation:

### 1. Strategy: Hybrid Disentangled Raycasting

Given the goal of better rendering complex medical geometry (like MRI scans), the priority must be **disentangling geometry from appearance**. This is essential for interpreting internal structures and supports physically-based rendering approaches.

The ideal architecture for this scenario is a **Hybrid Deferred Rendering Pipeline** (like FEGR or NRT), which combines the fidelity of neural fields with the efficiency of explicit ray tracing:

- **Neural Field for Primary Rays (G-Buffer):** Use a neural network, such as an MLP with **multi-resolution hash positional encoding**, to model the implicit geometry as a **Signed Distance Field (SDF)** ($s$) and estimate intrinsic material properties ($\mathbf{k_d}, \mathbf{k_s}, \mathbf{n}$). This differentiable volumetric rendering handles the initial view synthesis.
- **Explicit Mesh for Secondary Rays:** Extract an **explicit mesh ($\mathbf{S}$)** from the optimized SDF using Marching Cubes. This mesh acts as an **acceleration structure** for physics-based computations, enabling efficient visibility queries for secondary rays (e.g., shadows or multi-bounce transport).
- **Ray Casting Acceleration:** Leveraging ray tracing hardware via **OptiX** (accessible through Slang) allows the system to efficiently determine visibility ($v$) using **ray-mesh intersection queries** ($O(m)$ complexity).

### 2. Leveraging Compute for Pretraining and Efficiency

Pretraining provides a critical advantage, especially when handling a finite dataset size and aiming for high fidelity.

|Constraint/Resource|Application in the Pipeline|Source Support|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Pretraining Availability**|**1. Initializing Geometry (SDF):** Use the known distance fields (Boundary map $B(x)$ from preprocessing) to pre-train the SDF MLP early, minimizing the **Geometric Regularization Loss ($L_{geom}$)**. This stabilizes the geometry before optimizing reflectance/appearance.|The overall optimization scheme starts by focusing on direct reflection and learning the geometric SDF and the Lambertian BSDF. Optimization should initialize geometry first, then optimize other scene intrinsics.|
||**2. Encoder-Decoder for Appearance:** For complex tissue appearances, pretrain an **Encoder MLP** to map high-dimensional, multi-modal input features (FLAIR, T1, T2, probability $P(x)$) into a compact **latent code**. This reduces redundancy and improves interpolation.|Encoder-decoder architectures can convert traditional textures into a single multi-channel latent texture, which speeds up training and improves latent space structure.|
||**3. Network Weight Conversion:** Use pretraining time to convert 32-bit floating-point (FP32) network parameters into **half precision (FP16)** for efficient GPU execution during rendering/inference, potentially using Slang's **Cooperative Vector** functions.|Training can use FP32 master parameters, but efficient inferencing uses post-training quantization to FP16. Cooperative Vectors expose MMA hardware, offering efficient FLOPS.|
|**Limited Data (~140GB)**|**Sparse/Adaptive Representation:** Given that 140GB is relatively small for training large-scale, generalizable neural models, focusing on **sparse, adaptive representations** like Gaussian Basis Functions (RayGauss) or adaptive MLPs is prudent. This avoids wasting capacity on empty space and focuses fidelity on essential tumor/tissue regions.|Methods using Gaussians (RayGauss) or adaptive Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) allow parameters to adapt precisely to scene geometry without fixed resolution limits, improving detail representation.|
||**Augmentation/Regularization:** The data size necessitates strong supervision signals. Your preprocessed **Boundary maps $B(x)$** are vital for **geometric regularization** ($L_{geom}$). Use **perceptual losses (LPIPS/DSSIM)** instead of pure $L_2/L_1$ to maximize perceived quality from limited samples.|Reconstruction loss can use L1 and DSSIM. Perceptual loss improves perceptual metrics.|

### 3. Addressing Computational Trade-offs (SDF vs. Gaussians)

While the hybrid SDF approach (FEGR/NRT) offers superb interpretability via geometry disentanglement, the Gaussian-based volume ray casting (RayGauss) might be considered given the constraint of minimizing data usage while maximizing quality:

- **RayGauss (Gaussian Fields):** This method approximates density ($\sigma$) and emitted radiance ($\mathbf{c}$) using a weighted sum of **anisotropic Gaussian functions**. This yields excellent results while using a sparse, irregular representation that adapts optimally to geometry.
    - **Efficiency:** RayGauss uses a **slab-by-slab integration algorithm** leveraging a **BVH** acceleration structure, which significantly speeds up ray casting compared to naive sample-by-sample integration, achieving real-time rates (25 FPS on the Blender dataset).
    - **Fidelity:** Ray casting on Gaussians provides superior quality compared to splatting methods, avoiding artifacts like flickering and maintaining better coherence during training.

If you prioritize interpretability and geometry extraction, proceed with the **Hybrid SDF/Mesh (FEGR)** model. If you prioritize the absolute highest rendering quality and efficient volumetric representation for a fixed dataset, the **RayGauss** volumetric approach is highly competitive, especially since it is designed to work efficiently with GPU ray tracing frameworks like OptiX/Slang.

### 4. Implementation Steps Focused on Slang/Compute

1. **Model SDF/Geometry:** Implement the SDF model $s = f_{SDF}(\mathbf{x}; \theta_{SDF})$ using an MLP. Use your **Boundary map** data to drive the Eikonal regularization $R(SDF) = E_{\forall x}[||\nabla SDF(\mathbf{x})|| - 1]^2$.
2. **Define Differentiable Raycasting:** Write the volume rendering equation for the SDF in Slang, ensuring the density calculation $\rho(t)$ and the subsequent volume integral for G-Buffer properties are fully differentiable using **`bwd_diff`**.
3. **Implement Hybrid Step:** Use the pre-computed geometry ($B(x)$) or dynamically extracted mesh $\mathbf{S}$ (using **Marching Cubes**) for efficient visibility queries. Since the geometry changes during optimization, the mesh $\mathbf{S}$ should be re-extracted periodically (e.g., every 20 iterations).
4. **Optimize with Adam:** Use the Adam optimizer in Python (via SlangPy) to manage the training loop, applying the computed gradients (read from `RWTensor` gradient buffers) to update parameters in an optimization step.
5. **Leverage Hardware:** Implement the core MLP forward/backward passes using Slang's **Cooperative Vector** primitives (targeting FP16 data) to leverage GPU tensor cores for efficient, high-throughput calculation of matrix multiplications in the feed-forward layers.
   
Leveraging **PyTorch** for the main training loop and large model components, while using **Slang** for the efficient, hardware-accelerated runtime inference and custom differentiable operations, directly aligns with the best practices described in neural rendering literature. This strategy isolates complex optimization from runtime performance.

Here are thoughts on how to structure this dual-framework approach, focusing on pretraining objectives and the final deployment of learned weights, drawing heavily from the principles of Neural Ray-Tracing (NRT) and Neural Appearance Models:

### 1. PyTorch: The Pretraining and Optimization Hub

PyTorch is ideal for the core inverse rendering optimization due to its robustness and standardized environment for managing complex losses and architectures. The goal of this phase is to obtain high-fidelity parameters for geometry, appearance, and density fields.

#### A. Initializing Geometry (SDF Pretraining)

Given your precise geometric supervision (Boundary Map $B(x)$ as a Signed Distance Field, SDF), the initial PyTorch phase should focus on stabilizing the geometry model before introducing complex appearance details.

- **SDF MLP:** Train the MLP defining the SDF, $s = f_{SDF}(x; \theta_{SDF})$, by minimizing the geometric losses:
    - **Boundary Map Supervision:** Use the preprocessed $B(x)$ to directly supervise the learned distance field.
    - **Eikonal Regularization ($R(SDF)$):** Enforce the unit-norm gradient constraint on the SDF: $R(SDF) = E_{\forall x}[||\nabla SDF(x)|| - 1]^2$. This loss is crucial for geometry stability.
- **Volumetric Integration:** Implement the differentiable volumetric integration (G-buffer rendering) in PyTorch to compute Depth ($\mathbf{D}$) and Normal ($\mathbf{N}$) maps. These intermediate results are used for initial $\mathbf{L_1}$ and depth losses.

#### B. Training Disentangled Appearance

Once the geometry parameters $\theta_{SDF}$ are reasonably initialized, the large appearance networks (reflectance/material MLPs) can be trained. The structure should mirror the successful disentangled architectures:

- **Decomposed Reflectance/Material (BSDF/PBR):** The appearance is parameterized by a combination of analytic priors (Lambertian component) and learned residuals (specular, complex scattering):
    - **Base Color ($k_d$):** Represented by an MLP, defining the diffuse albedo.
    - **Residual/Learned BSDF ($f_{Learned}$):** Represented by a separate MLP that handles specular highlights and other complex, high-frequency components. This improves representation power and efficiency.
    - **Input Features:** Feed the multi-modal MRI features (FLAIR, T1, T2, $P(x)$) as inputs, along with the 3D position $x$, to the appearance MLPs.
- **Loss Functions:** Use comprehensive losses in PyTorch:
    - **L1/L2 Loss:** For image reconstruction against the target scan slices ($\hat{I}$ vs. $I_{ref}$).
    - **Perceptual Losses:** **LPIPS** or **DSSIM** (structural dissimilarity) are highly effective alternatives to pure L1/L2 loss for maximizing perceived quality, especially useful given your limited $\sim 140$GB dataset.
    - **Shading Regularization ($L_{shade}$):** Use the ROI/Segmentation maps to encourage consistency in material properties within semantic tissue classes (e.g., necrosis vs. enhancing tumor), reducing ambiguity (baking shadows into albedo).

### 2. Slang: The Efficient Runtime Implementation

The output of the PyTorch training is a set of optimized parameters (weights, biases, latent textures) for all networks ($\theta_{SDF}, \theta_{mat}$). These weights are then transferred to the Slang environment for fast inference and deployment.

#### A. Weight Conversion and Optimization

This step is crucial for achieving real-time performance, leveraging Slang's hardware acceleration features.

1. **Precision Conversion:** Convert the master parameters (trained in FP32 in PyTorch) to **half precision (FP16)** for efficient GPU execution.
2. **Layout Optimization:** Since Slang uses **Cooperative Vector** functions to leverage GPU **Tensor Cores (MMA hardware)** for matrix multiplication, the weights must be converted to the specialized _Inferencing Optimal_ matrix layouts expected by these intrinsics. This conversion is best done offline during the transition from PyTorch/CPU to Slang/GPU deployment.

#### B. Slang Implementation of Core Operations

The Slang application handles the forward pass (rendering) of the hybrid raycasting model.

1. **Differentiable Ray Casting (Forward):** Implement the core volumetric rendering equation in Slang, including the opaque density calculation derived from the SDF.
    - While the bulk of training occurs in PyTorch, having the rendering equation differentiable in Slang allows for potential **runtime fine-tuning** or solving small inverse problems (e.g., adjusting a single viewpoint’s lighting or exposure) using **Slang's `bwd_diff` automatic differentiation feature**.
2. **MLP Inference via Cooperative Vectors:** The core of the SDF and material estimation relies on small MLPs. Implement the feed-forward layer calculation using the `coopVecMatMulAdd` intrinsics. This bypasses the slower general matrix multiplication and uses specialized, high-throughput hardware instructions.
3. **Hybrid Step (Visibility/Occlusion):** Use Slang's integration with ray tracing hardware (e.g., OptiX/DXR through Slang) to efficiently perform **ray-mesh intersection queries** ($O(m)$ complexity) on the explicit mesh extracted from the SDF. This is essential for accurately modeling occlusion (shadows) necessary for visual depth perception in medical visualization. This specialized hybrid rendering approach is significantly more efficient than tracing volumetric queries for every ray bounce ($O(n^2)$ complexity).

### 3. Combining Architecture Concepts

This approach can benefit from concepts used in real-time neural materials to handle the appearance complexity inherent in MRI data:

- **Spatially-Varying BRDF:** The material MLPs should be designed to receive **positional encoding** (e.g., multi-resolution hash encoding) and the preprocessed input features (T1, T2, $P(x)$) to produce a **spatially-varying BSDF**.
- **Neural Texture/Latent Codes:** If the geometry is static, appearance variations could be encoded in a compressed **Latent Texture** (neural texture) using an encoder-decoder architecture in PyTorch. The decoder MLP, running efficiently in Slang, then interprets this texture. This uses very little VRAM compared to traditional textures and scales well to high-resolution detail.
  

This is a strategic choice that balances the need for computational efficiency with the desire for platform generality, while embracing modern, data-driven scene representations. By prioritizing **general compute shaders** over hardware-specific features for the hybrid step, and incorporating **neural texture/latent codes**, you are aligning your project with highly effective, interpretable, and generalizable inverse rendering architectures described in the sources.

Here is an analysis of your proposal, drawing on the relevant principles of neural rendering, geometry handling, and acceleration strategies found in the sources.

1. Implementing the Hybrid Step with General Compute Shaders

Your previous plan suggested using highly optimized, hardware-dependent ray tracing libraries like **OptiX** for secondary ray queries. By opting instead for **general compute shaders** (which can be efficiently implemented in Slang), you maintain the crucial hybrid structure while ensuring broader compatibility.

A. The Hybrid Concept (G-Buffer + Secondary Rays)

The hybrid deferred rendering pipeline, as exemplified by Neural Ray-Tracing (NRT) and FEGR, is essential for disentangling geometry and appearance.

1. **Primary Rays (G-Buffer):** This step remains the same: Volumetric rendering of the **Signed Distance Field (SDF)** to generate the G-buffer (Normal $\mathbf{N}$, Base Color $\mathbf{K_d}$, Material $\mathbf{M}$, Depth $\mathbf{D}$). This is inherently differentiable and can be handled entirely by compute shaders performing volumetric integration.

2. **Secondary Rays (Visibility/Occlusion):** This is where your choice impacts implementation. The hybrid approach requires efficient visibility queries (ray-surface intersection) to calculate cast shadows and occlusion effects. Since hardware acceleration (e.g., DXR/OptiX) is excluded, you must rely on mesh acceleration structures or optimized SDF traversal implemented via compute:

    ◦ **Geometry Extraction:** You still need to **extract an explicit mesh** $\mathbf{S}$ from the SDF (using Marching Cubes) periodically during training.

    ◦ **Compute-based Ray-Mesh Intersection:** Instead of relying on specialized hardware, the ray-mesh intersection query must be solved using parallel algorithms within a general compute shader. This is analogous to how modern path tracers or SDF renderers optimize performance:

        ▪ **Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) Implementation:** The mesh $\mathbf{S}$ can be organized into a custom **BVH** structure. Compute shaders can then implement the ray traversal and intersection logic themselves.

        ▪ **SDF Grid Traversal Optimization:** For SDF grids, efficient compute implementations exist for analytic ray-voxel intersection. Methods like **Sparse Voxel Set (SVS)** combined with an **Analytic cubic solver (A)** for voxel intersection are among the fastest techniques when leveraging the GPU's general compute capabilities for traversal. Utilizing an explicit mesh simplifies light integration (secondary rays) to $O(m)$ complexity, a vast improvement over $O(n^2)$ complexity associated with purely volumetric sampling.

B. Importance of Explicit Mesh and SDF Grids

The explicit geometric structure is particularly valuable for complex visualization tasks like medical rendering, where accurate spatial location of features (e.g., tumor boundaries) matters:

• **Accurate Occlusion:** The mesh allows you to compute visibility $v$ explicitly. This ensures that "cast shadows" or self-occlusion effects, which aid in depth perception of the rendered internal structures, are accurately modeled based on the learned geometry, rather than implicitly baked into the radiance field.

• **Continuous Normals:** When reconstructing SDFs in a grid, the surface normals computed analytically from the gradient of the implicit function (SDF) are $\mathbf{C^2}$ continuous inside each voxel. Furthermore, using compute shaders, you can implement methods that interpolate normals across neighboring voxels to achieve superior smoothness across voxel boundaries when close to the surface. Smoother normals result in significantly better rendered image quality, especially at close-up views of complex surfaces.

2. Incorporating Neural Texture/Latent Codes

The decision to use **neural texture/latent codes** fits perfectly with the PyTorch pretraining strategy and Slang runtime environment, providing an efficient way to manage and deploy the complex appearance data derived from multi-modal MRI inputs.

A. Neural Texture Representation

Instead of conventional textures (which scale poorly with resolution and material complexity), neural texture methods bake the appearance information into a compact latent space.

• **Encoder/Decoder Structure (PyTorch Training):** During your PyTorch pretraining phase, an **Encoder MLP** should be trained to convert the high-dimensional, multi-modal material parameters (Albedo, Roughness, Specular, and importantly, the preprocessed **FLAIR, T1, T2, and Tumor Probability $P(x)$ features**) into a compact, fixed-size **Latent Code $\mathbf{z}(\mathbf{x})$**. This encoder handles the complex mapping of your 140GB of data into a structured latent space, ensuring that similar input parameters map to similar points in the latent space, which improves interpolation and stability.

• **Latent Texture (Deployment):** This latent code is stored in a compressed, hierarchical structure called the **latent texture**. The latent texture resolution should match the desired output fidelity of the SDF (e.g., your initial grid resolution).

B. Efficient Slang Deployment (Runtime Shading)

The strength of this approach is realized in the Slang runtime environment, where tiny decoder MLPs run efficiently within your compute shaders.

• **Small Decoder MLPs:** The actual shading computation is handled by a small **Decoder MLP** that maps the latent code $\mathbf{z}(\mathbf{x})$ and direction vectors to the final appearance properties (e.g., BRDF/BSDF values, $\mathbf{k_d}$, $\mathbf{k_s}$).

• **Hardware Acceleration (Cooperative Vectors):** While you eschewed hardware-dependent _ray tracing_ features, you can still leverage **Cooperative Vectors** (available in Slang) to accelerate the **MLP evaluation** inside your general compute shader.

    ◦ Cooperative Vectors expose **hardware-accelerated Tensor Core operations (MMA)** to shader code.

    ◦ This is achieved by implementing the network's forward pass (matrix multiplication) using specialized `coopVecMatMulAdd` intrinsics in Slang. This significantly speeds up the shading calculations, offering over a $3\times$ speedup compared to highly optimized non-Cooperative Vector code.

    ◦ The learned FP32 weights from PyTorch must be converted to **FP16** and arranged into an **Inferencing Optimal matrix layout** for maximum efficiency in the Slang shader.

This architecture provides an efficient way to render high-fidelity, multi-modal material characteristics (tissue types, pathology regions) without the performance hit associated with running large, complex MLPs or relying on traditional texture lookups.
